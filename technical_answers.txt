1. What is data engineering?
Data engineering is the practice of developing systems with the purpose of moving and transforming data from one place and shape to another following any given business needs.

2. What are the main responsabilities of a Data Engineer?
The main responsabilities of a data engineer are building and maintaining data pipelines to ensure that the data keeps flowing to satisfy business demands.  

3. Explain ETL.
ETL stands for Extract, Transform and Load.
It is a basic workflow for data engineers. This workflow or routine consists in extracting data from a source, transform it accordingly to predefined business rules and loading it into a landing zone where it will be queried by a final user.  

4. How you build a Data Pipeline?
To build a data pipeline you need to create a system than extracts data from a source and loads it into another.

5. In RDBMS, the Join command is your friend. Explain why.
One of the main benefits of Relational Databases is that it allows to reduce data redundancy by normalizing the data. 
Normalizing is a process This means that instead of writing several times the same piece of information, you extract once this information into another table and keep .
Since the data is spread in tables, to get all the information for a record one would have to join this mentioned tables. 
That's why in RDBMS the join command is your friend: data is spread in different tables and to get a full record you need the join command. 

6. What are the main features of a production pipeline?


7. How do you monitor a data pipeline? 


8. Give us a situation where you decide to use a NoSQL database instead of a RDB and explain why.


9. What a re the non-technical soft skills that are most valuable for data engineers?
I think that the most valuable non-technical soft skill for a data engineer to have is business feeling. 
Another valuable soft skill is openness 


10. Suppose you have to design an Anomaly Detection Solution for a client in real or near real time.
Which technologies do you apply for real time ingestion and stream for an anomaly detection system? Diagram the solution in AWS or GCP Infrastructure.


11. Explain the differences between OLAP and OLTP Systems.
Online Transactional Process systems are concerned in capturing in the most efficient manner data that is generated by the interaction between an user and the busisness platform (website, onpremise transactions).
While Online Analytical Platoform systems are concerned in modifying the business data for analysis.
